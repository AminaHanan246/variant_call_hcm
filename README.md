This study is to examine gene expression profiles in 18 HCM patients and compare them with those in 5 healthy controls. The hypothesis tested here is whether patient individual-level transcriptome data integrated with the human interactom can implicate the heterogenity of HCM phenotypes.In this study, we also analyze DNA whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 18 patients. Overall design: Transcriptome analysis was performed on anterior septal tissues from frozen hearts of HCM patients and left ventriular wall tissue from healthy controls by deep sequencing. Whole exome sequencing were performed on the same tissues for 18 HCM patients. Less...
